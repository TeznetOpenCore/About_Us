							Teznet Mission Statement

Teznet exists to ensure the long-term survival and thriving of human society in the face of existential threatsâ€”from magnetic pole shifts to global conflict, from asteroids to biological and digital plagues. We build resilient, interconnected systems that are design to be a way of decentralized governance, and community-integrated infrastructure. Our mission is not profit, instead it is preservation. Because no company, nation, or individual survives if civilization falls.

The tokenization of open-source surveillance nodes enable developers to influence key decisions regarding drone and cycler deployment, access permissions, and system behavior. This transparent framework empowers a global community to shape the governance of critical infrastructure through a decentralized, democratic process.
